# ALLSEEINGEYE IPv4 Address Space Enumeration Toolkit
A toolkit designed to enable the user to rapidly enumerate large sections of the IPv4 address space using self supplied zcat datasets, or to pull data from Shodan/Censys, and extract relevant data via CSV. 

It also features Netcat, Telnet, OpenSSL, and SSH connection functionality with the option to easily add more.

It's written entirely in Bash, and can should be portable across *NIX, WSL, and macOS without too many issues.

##Requirements:

Requires ``shodan`` binary.

``sudo apt install shodan`` (Linux)
``sudo brew install shodan`` (macOS)
